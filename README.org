#+TITLE: tree-sitter-gcc

A collection of tree-sitter grammars for GCC's internal languages, including:
  * Machine Description files (~.md~)
  * RTL dumps
  * GIMPLE dumps
  * ~match.pd~ pattern files

Like other tree-sitter grammars this is intended to be hooked into editors on their own.
For Emacs, you should use [[https://github.com/KarlJoad/gcc-modes][gcc-modes]].

This takes inspiration from [[https://github.com/RegAlloc/gcc-syntax-highlighting][gcc-syntax-highlighting]] for VSCode/VSCodium.
